# Titanic-Survival-Predictor
## Description
### Dataset:
'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv'

In this project, I applied *three calssification techniques:*

1.Logistic Regression

2.Random Forest

3.XGBOOST

Then, I compared their effectiveness using classification reports.

### Techniques

-Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

-Feature Selection

-Feature Importances from Random Forest

-Classification models to predict Survival

-Shap Visualisation

-Scikit-learn,Seaborn,Matplotlib

### Results

When compared, Random Forest gave best accuracy results while predicting survival when compared to XGBOOST and Logistic Regression.

### Tools Used
-Python(Pandas,Scikit-learn,Matplotlib,Seaborn,SHAP)
-Jupyter Notebook
